# Java version of the solution.

Implementation based on the series "Number of partitions of n into at least two distinct parts." http://oeis.org/A111133

## Recursive tree

Effectively, this algorithm constructs a binary tree of (𝑛,𝑘) values for each step-down. Due to the nature of 𝑓(𝑛−𝑘,𝑘) converging to 0, for >> numbers this results in a rather deep recursion. Due to this, a rather optimistic stack size is needed with ~20m of stack needed to fully recurse the algorithm for 300000.

## Memoization

As stated above, memoization is the integral part of this implementation, with processing being in 𝑂(3/2𝑛) time. With each subsequent iteration of 𝑘, a cache matrix is updated with the 𝑘=i; => 𝑓(𝑛,𝑘) combinations. The computed numbers as recursion is computed, grow exponentially

For only n>150, the numbers grow exponential, making them not fit the 'long' primitive even as soon as for ~ n=800, introducing the need for dynamic integers such as BigInteger and Huldra's BigInt (https://github.com/bwakell/Huldra), which is used here with minimal changes for more optimised additions and space consumptions.

Examples above - space consumption for n=100k, which produces the following number:
`42494159403332317292526619504218136903700576932083624292980870857936616016516019121515022089648672327193383380680571759727227416036821183744674051457194041711141429085626371124196057902283995836976239181670821800000403741232325992196887134172549`

With numbers as these, cached for each (𝑛,𝑘), the space requirements grow exponentially. There should exist a (𝑛,𝑘)-eviction formula for subsequent 𝑘  iterations, due to the nature the series converges to 0.

## How to Run
Requires:
- Java 8
- Maven (for Java 8)
Jenv(with mvn plugin) is recommended for both maven and java.

Build `jar` with `mvn clean install`. 

Run from the source dir with `java -Xss${StackSize} -Xmx${HeapSize} -XX:+UseG1GC -jar target/untitled1-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar n`.
